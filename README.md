This is a *very early* work in progress source code of SpoOky's Advanced Genie Editor... Sadly, it does not currently build but, I have made some decent progress.
I was trying to clean up the code wherever I could, fix issues, etc. The solution file is in the "build" directory.
(Release is currently the best build type. (64 Bit.) Debug is extremely broke.)
If anyone wants to help me out, I will gladly accept it. I am doing what I know I can. Some things however, I do not know how to do...

To summarize What I did: 1: I renamed all the files with a prefix from where they were from. Meaning:

A_*: Age Files.
G_*: Genie Files.
P_*: Pcrio Files.
U_*: Extra Files. (Not many but, I will look into them later on.)

2: I removed the precompile header stuff. (This was driving me nuts.) Besides, you could just add this to the top of main anyhow... Which I did.
I kept the old files for now just in case they are still needed but, I rather not go that route if need be.

3: I went though all the code, checked for anything I could possibly fix myself from suggestions. (I hope I didn't break anything. Although, I think they are fine...)

There is currently about 100 errors in the Release build. I could use your help with them.
