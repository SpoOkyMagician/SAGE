This is a *very early* work in progress of SpoOky's Advanced Genie Editor... Sadly, it does not currently build but, I have made some decent progress.
I was trying to clean up the code wherever I could, fix issues, etc. The solution file is in the "build" directory.
(Release is currently the best build type. Debug is extremely broke.)
If anyone wants to help me out, I will gladly accept it. I am doing what I know I can. Some things however, I do not know how to do...
